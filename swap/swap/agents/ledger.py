    Data structure used in an agent to keep track of all interactions

    Uses dynamic references inside the transactions to directly link each
    transaction to the acting agent. For example, each transaction in a ledger
    for a subject will have a reference to the user making the classification

    This allows quick recalculations as the ledger has direct access to
    the memory location of the relevant agent. This ledger is also intended
    for use with online bureaus to reduce memory load, and can dereference
    agents and rebuild reference trees arbitrarily from a bureau
